    "\n",
    "I added dropout layers in the beginning and turns out that it affected performance, so ended up not using them.\n",
    "I found out with dropouts the car wasn't able to steer sharp turns with model used, as I peeled off dropout the model was able to take sharp turns and pass the tracks. I could have increased the size of model but removing dropouts worked effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 20,73). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",

    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I have used the data provided by Udacity for tuning the data. I really wanted to see if I can get the car running without collecting recovery data as we might have the luxury recollecting data using real-car. I was able to get the model working with Udacity however it required heavy usage of data augumentation techniques. I will describe in detail below, the data augumentation techniques I have used. \n",

    "**1. Solution Design Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to use \n",
    "* simple single fully connected layer to get the simulator, code up and running\n",
    "* I then used a model similar to the one used by nVIDIA\n",
    "* Then I add pre-processing and data augumentation to overcome the issues such as steering to left, right and not steering enough\n",
    "* Then I went iterated between increasing of model parameters, data augumentation to fine tune model\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the nVIDIA model. I thought this model might be appropriate because nVIDIA was able to get an end-to-end driving system using the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. To combat the overfitting, I modified the model I added dropout. I tried many techniques to tune the model, I will list some of the techniques which lead me to follow the path rather than all iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Step 1: Data Augumentation by flipping images**\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that the car initially had bias towards left side, this was probably because most of the track was towards left. So, I flipped the images using OpenCV and negated steering angle (lines 122-14 of data_gen.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "** Step 2: Data Augumentation by using left and center cameras**\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that the car now started bias towards right side some times. I used left and right cameras to augument more data so that it can chose between left and right appropriately (lines 101-109 of data_gen.py). I used offset of +/-0.25 as steering offset for left and right images respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Creating equal amount of images for all steering angles**\n",
    "After this, I found can moving along some distance nicely, but it was going too smoothly and had issues with turns.\n",
    "So, I  created equal amount of data points for all steering angles with data augumentation. This lead to car able to get till the bridge but it was going into open space after the bridge\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Step 4: More cropping**\n",
    "After much frustration, I found that by cropping more than initial amount, I was able to get the car steer steeper.\n",
    "After this and some tuning, the car was able to cross the bridge but was always going to open muddy road after the bridge. I spent lot of time tuning for this. I think this helped because without proper cropping, the model was picking irrelevant features such as trees in it's decision. By cropping the image more, I was able to tune the model to focus only the road & it's features.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, I started playing by increasing and decreased dropout ratio, adding/removing dropout from multiple layers.\n",
